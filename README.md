# LongLiveScala3
A dive into the world of Scala.
After working in Scala for a while now, I decided to present Scala's best functionalities when compared to its other JVM sisters (mainly Java). 
I tackled 12 different topics in order to present Scala's strong (and weak points):
1. Intro about the language: history, motivation, current usages. How to think Scala style.
2. DTOs in Scala
3. Collections in Scala (mainly list, set and map)
4. Interfaces in Scala (inheritance, behavior)
5. Class extensions in Scala (Scala implicit, Kotlin?) 
6. Optionals in Scala  (Some/Nulls/Nullable types)
7. Stream processing in Scala / Streams in Scala (at least filter, map, fold, collect operations)
8. Best use of Scala IMO
9. Features I love about Scala
10. Error handling and exception
11. Testing

In order to present these different functionalities, I created different mocked classes that mimic real world behaviour. One example of this is the Singleton object created under errorHandling package used as a replacement for a real database connection just to serve as support for showcasing functionality.
Trying to put emphasis on best capabilities of Scala.
