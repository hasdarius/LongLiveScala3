# LongLiveScala3
A dive into the world of Scala.
After working in Scala for a while now, I decided to present Scala's best functionalities when compared to its other JVM sisters (mainly Java). 
I tackled 12 different topics in order to present Scala's strong (and weak points):
1.	Intro about the language: history, motivation, current usages
2.	DTOs in Scala
3.	Collections in Scala (mainly list, set and map)
4.	Interfaces in Scala (inheritance, behavior)
5.	Class extensions in Scala (Scala implicit, Kotlin?) 
6.	Optionals in Scala  (Some/Nulls/Nullable types)
7.	Stream processing in Scala / Streams in Scala (at least filter, map, fold, collect operations)
9.	Best use of Scala IMO
10.	Features I love about Scala
11.	Error handling and exception
12.	Testing
